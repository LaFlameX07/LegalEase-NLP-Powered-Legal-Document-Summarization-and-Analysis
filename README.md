LegalEase: NLP-Powered Legal Document Summarization and Analysis
================================================================

Welcome to **LegalEase**, an innovative tool designed to revolutionize how legal professionals, researchers, and students interact with complex legal documents. Leveraging advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, LegalEase automates the summarization, entity extraction, and sentiment analysis of legal texts, saving time and enhancing productivity.

Project Overview
----------------

Legal documents are often dense, lengthy, and filled with jargon, making them time-consuming to analyze. LegalEase addresses this challenge by providing a robust, AI-driven solution that processes legal texts with precision. Built with Python and state-of-the-art NLP libraries, this project empowers users to extract key insights, identify critical entities, and gauge sentiment effortlessly.

Key Features
------------

-   **Automated Summarization**: Generates concise, accurate summaries of lengthy legal documents, capturing essential points without losing context.

-   **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifies and extracts key entities such as names, organizations, dates, and legal terms with high accuracy.

-   **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes the tone of legal texts to provide insights into the emotional or argumentative context (e.g., positive, negative, or neutral sentiment).

-   **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed for ease of use, with intuitive outputs for legal professionals and non-experts alike.

-   **Customizable Pipeline**: Flexible NLP pipeline that allows users to tailor preprocessing, summarization, and analysis to specific needs.

-   **Scalable Architecture**: Capable of handling large volumes of documents, making it suitable for law firms, academic research, and more.

Why LegalEase?
--------------

-   **Time-Saving**: Reduces hours of manual document review to minutes of automated analysis.

-   **Accuracy**: Utilizes cutting-edge NLP models (e.g., BERT, SpaCy, or Hugging Face Transformers) for reliable results.

-   **Versatile Applications**: Ideal for legal research, contract analysis, case preparation, and academic studies.

-   **Open-Source**: Freely accessible, encouraging collaboration and customization by the community.

Installation
------------

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.8+

-   pip (Python package manager)

-   Virtual environment (recommended)

### Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository**:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LegalEase.git
    cd LegalEase
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment**:

    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    Required libraries include spacy, transformers, nltk, and others listed in requirements.txt.

4.  **Download NLP Models**: Run the following to download pre-trained models (e.g., for SpaCy):

    ```
    python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg
    ```

5.  **Run the Application**:

    ```
    python main.py
    ```

Usage
-----

1.  **Prepare Your Documents**: Place legal documents (e.g., .txt, .pdf) in the input/ directory.

2.  **Run the Pipeline**:

    ```
    python main.py --input input/your_document.txt --output results/
    ```

    Options:

    -   --summarize: Generate a summary.

    -   --ner: Perform Named Entity Recognition.

    -   --sentiment: Conduct sentiment analysis.

3.  **View Results**: Outputs (summaries, entities, sentiment scores) are saved in the results/ directory.

Example
-------

**Input Document**: A 50-page contract with clauses on intellectual property and liability.

**Output**:

-   **Summary**: A 200-word summary highlighting key obligations and terms.

-   **Entities**: Extracted entities like "Acme Corp", "January 2025", and "Non-Disclosure Agreement".

-   **Sentiment**: Neutral tone with a confidence score of 0.85.
